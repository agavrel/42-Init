# Get the complete path of the file that contains the IP address of the DNS server youâ€™re using
cat /var/run/resolv.conf

# Deduction
# etc/resolv.conf contains the IP address of the used DNS server
# However 'ls -l etc/resolv.conf' will produce the following output:
# lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  22 Nov 20  2016 /etc/resolv.conf -> ../var/run/resolv.conf
# which is a symbolic link.
